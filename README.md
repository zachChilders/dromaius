I'm slowly working on an ARM emulator, it's pretty bad but it'll work eventually

Inspired by FuzzWeek, I'm currently learning low level concepts. 
I want to learn on my own and not copy too much of Brandon's code (although I stole a whole bunch right away), but after a subset of instructions are implemented
I definitely want to use it for fuzzing.

At the moment, I'm still laying out memory and loading executables.  After this, I'll add some registers and then finally start implementing a million opcodes.
